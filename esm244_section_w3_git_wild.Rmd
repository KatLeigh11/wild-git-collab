## Part A: Make edits (no conflict)

```{r partner_1a}
# Partner 1: 
# Run the code below to see the original graph
# Change the code below to make the point color change based on 'cut', and update the theme to theme_bw(). Update the title to include your first name. 

ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = cut)) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Kat was here")
```

```{r partner_2a}
# Partner 2: 
# Run the code below to see the original graph
# Change the code below to make the geom a geom_jitter, and update the theme to theme_light. Update the title to include your first name. 

ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = color, y = carat)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  theme_light() +
  labs(title = "Kat2 was here")
```

## PART B: Make problems

```{r break-it-1}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = depth, y = carat)) +
  geom_col(aes(color = carat, shape = cut)) +
  theme_minimal() + labs(title = "Kat1 is here")
```

```{r break-it-2}

ggplot(data = cars, aes(x=dist, y=speed))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_jitter(color = "salmon")+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title= "speed and distance to stop of cars")

```
